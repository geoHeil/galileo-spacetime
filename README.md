Galileo Continuum is a high-throughput distributed file system for spatio-temporal multidimensional data, developed at the Colorado State University Computer Science Department. This project is a fork of the original system developed by [Mathew Malensek](https://github.com/malensek/galileo) for geospatial datasets.
